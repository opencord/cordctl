# Development Environment

To run unit tests, `go-junit-report` and `gocover-obertura` tools must be installed. One way to do this is to install them with `go get`, and then ensure your `GOPATH` is part of your `PATH` (editing your `~/.profile` as necessary). 

```bash
go get -u github.com/jstemmer/go-junit-report
go get -u github.com/t-yuki/gocover-cobertura
```
